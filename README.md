# calculator
Project Description

This project is a Command-Line Calculator built in Python to perform basic arithmetic operations in an interactive way.
It supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, each implemented as a separate function for modularity and clarity.
The calculator includes robust input validation, ensuring users can only enter valid numbers and menu choices.
It also gracefully handles division by zero without crashing, displaying a user-friendly error message.
The program runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit, making it practical for repeated calculations.
No external libraries or datasets are required â€” it works out of the box with any standard Python installation.
The project demonstrates clean coding practices, error handling, and user interaction in a CLI environment.
It is a good example of a beginner-friendly Python project that showcases fundamental programming concepts.
Screenshots and a simple README are included for clarity and documentation.
Future improvements could include adding calculation history, parsing full expressions, or integrating with a GUI.
This repository serves as a hands-on mini-project for learners exploring Python basics and CLI app development.
